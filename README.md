# Low_birth_weight_prediction

<b> Description </b> <br>

Prediction of low birth weight based on the data set by using machine learning(Regression analysis) based on the dataset 

Possibilty of low birth weight based on the algorithm.

I used ARD, Logistic and Lasso Regression models. 

Trained on the data sets to predict the actual values

Run the script(python)

Open Jupyter notebook terminal and open Yerramsetti_Vijay_A1_Regression_Analysis.ipynb.

Locate the dataset(birthweight_low.xlsx) file location correctly in birth_weight_prediction.ipynb .
